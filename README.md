# node-onesignal-backend
This repository contains a demo of backend application based on Node.js utilizing OneSignal push notifications service provider. It was created along writing my blog post, but can be easily used on its own.

All the commits are rather small, so that it's easy go through them step-by-step and analyze all the changes.
